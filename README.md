# Artworks_Classification

This project is based on the kaggle dataset [Best Artworks of All Time](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time).
It's a collection of artworks from 50 worldwide known painters. The objective is to train a model to learn the style of these masters and later try to predict who is the painter of a never-seen dataset.

## The Notebook
For this project, I'm working on the resized dataset.

This project explores the use of data loaders, fine-tuning transfer learning, ResNets and learning rate scheduler.

## Software version
* conda 4.7.12
* python 3.7.4
* ptorch 1.3.1
